A valid human readable address e.g. `cosmos1...` 2. A valid Andromeda VFS path e.g. `/home/user/app/component`\n\nVFS paths can be local in the case of an app and can be done by referencing `./component` they can also contain protocols for cross chain communication. A VFS path is usually structured as so:\n\n`<protocol>://<chain (required if ibc used)>/<path>` or `ibc://cosmoshub-4/user/app/component`","type":"string","$original_type":"AndrAddr"},"is_mutable":{"type":"boolean"},"name":{"type":["string","null"]}},"additionalProperties":false,"$original_type":"Module"},"title":"Modules"},"owner":{"type":["string","null"],"title":"Owner"}},"additionalProperties":false,"$id":"timelock","version":"0.2.1","classifier":"escrow","class":"baseADO"},"ui-schema":{"kernel_address":{"ui:widget":"hidden"}},"form-data":{}}
