# Introduction

In the Andromeda web-app, you can find a section called the App Store. We will be taking a closer look at what this section contains and how it works.

Essentially, the App Store contains a variety of Andromeda Apps that a user can purchase and configure directly without having to build anything from scratch. You can think of them as pre-built App templates that usually tackle a popular web-3 use case.

For example, if a user wants to make a marketplace to sell NFTs, they can choose to buy it directly from the App store where all the different components and ADOs needed for the marketplace are already set up and ready to be run on-chain. All the user needs to do is fill in the required settings for their App and then run. This is a pre-configured setup to minimize complexity and time spent for our users.
Take a look below at the App Store Home Page:

As you can see, the App Store home page, similar to other app stores, contains the Apps that can be searched, researched, and purchased by the user. For each App, the following information is shown:

1. The name of the App
2. The creator of the App
3. A short description of the App
4. The categories that the App belongs to

You will also notice a checkmark next to the publisher name. This signifies that it is a verified App, meaning that it has been audited and approved by Andromeda itself.

# Who can sell Apps in the App store?

Currently the App store contains Apps built by Andromeda that have been tested and verified to ensure security and functionality, but that does not mean that only Andromeda is allowed to publish Apps. On the contrary, the App store will be available for any developer that wants to build and sell web-3 Andromeda apps/solutions to the public.

# Buying an App

Once the user knows which App they want to buy, the select it and will be taken to the following screen (Auction Based Marketplace as the example below):

# Why learn ADO’s?

As you can see, a longer description is provided and all the app-related information for the App can be found on the right-hand side of the screen. This information includes:
- The Creator of the App
- The version to indicate the version of the ADOs used in the App
- The publishing date of the App and the date it was last updated
- The category the App belongs to (Ex. Defi)
- Some specific use cases for the App
- A link to the documentation for the App where the user can learn more about the App and it’s components
- The components used in the App aka the ADOs used to build the App

Once the user has reviewed this information and it meets their needs, they can choose to run the App.

The App is already set up, but the user still needs to provide the configurations to the App.

If a user wants to build an Auction marketplace for example, they need to set the following:
- Name of the App,
- The NFT collection itself including artwork and attributes of each NFT
- The minter of the NFT
- Any custom royalties or taxes for the auction etc,…

Once all the configurations are set, the user can then publish the App.

Note: The App will be published to the chain that you are currently connected to.
