## Guide-1: Building An App (from a Blank Canvas)

**SETUP**

* In this guide, you will be utilizing the ADO Builder tool to construct custom Andromeda Apps.
* To begin, launch the ADO Builder and select the option for a Blank Canvas. This option should be used when starting from scratch and building the App from the ground up.
* Next you will be directed to the main ADO builder interface. Here you can name your App. Make sure your App is connected to the desired chain and then click Publish.
* Before the App is deployed on your desired chain, you’ll be asked to approve the cost required to do so. Click “Broadcast” to approve the cost.
* Next you’ll have the option to add a memo or note to the transaction. This can be used to provide additional information about the App or to include any relevant details about the transaction. 
* Finally, select the fee range you want to pay for the transaction. This fee will be used to compensate the network for processing the transaction and deploying your App. Selecting a low or high fee range will affect the priority of your transaction on the chain and, as a result, the time it takes to complete the transaction. Usually selecting “Average” fees will suffice.
* Select “Approve” to give the final approval for deploying the App.
* Congratulations, you have successfully deployed your first Andromeda App on chain!

**VIEW TRANSACTION INFO**

* Pressing on the transaction hash will open up the transaction in a block explorer where all the details of the transaction are displayed.

**WORKING WITH YOUR APP**

* When you press Close, you are taken to the **Assets** page.
* The Assets page contains all the Apps and ADOs that have been deployed by the connected wallet. For each component of the App you are given some key information. You can see additional details by pressing on the ”View” button to the right of the address.
* When you want to communicate with an App, you can do so by "executing messages." To execute a message, simply find the component you wish to communicate with and click on the three dots (ellipsis) to the right of it. This will bring up a list of all the messages that can be executed by that particular component.
* If you feel confident in what you just learned, jump to the next guide “Building your First NFT Collection” where you will take things one step further.

## Guide 2: Minting Your First NFT Collection (from a template)

**SETUP**

* Open up a new blank canvas and name your App.
* Select “Add App Component” to add an ADO to your App. Since this is for building an NFT collection, choose the CW721 ADO. A quick sidenote, If you aren’t familiar with an ADO, you can click on the documentation link below the description which will open up the ADO's own documentation page.
* Add the CW721 to the App.
* Choose a suitable name for the component to start configuring the CW721 panel. An example may be “My NFT Collection”
* The CW721 panel has 3 required fields. The Minter Address or Identifier Address, the Token or NFT Name, and the Token or NFT Symbol.
* Next, export your App so it can be reimported later on or shared with other people by clicking on the “Download” symbol to the left of the publish button.
* Once you have saved a copy of the App, you can publish it.
* You will then be redirected to the assets page where the App you built will appear. It may take up to 30 seconds for it to appear, so you may want to refresh the page
* Check on your components by clicking on the down arrow on the far right of the App.

**MINTING**

* Our aim in this example is to mint an NFT collection. To do so, you will need to execute messages on your CW721. 
* There are three main types of execute messages within the Apps when it comes to permissioning. Contract Owner Restricted Messages, Asset Owner Restricted Messages, and Non-Restricted Messages.
* By default, the App component is assigned as the owner of all the other components. This means that all Contract Owner Restricted Messages of the components can only be sent by the App.
* Next, set up the Claim Ownership message that transfers ownership of all the components to your address (Owner/creator address of the App). 
 `Note :If you do not wish to claim the components, then use the Proxy Message to execute these messages on the components through the App.`
* Proxy Message is a Contract Owner Restricted Message which will take your message and send it through the App component (Giving you access to the Contract Owner Restricted messages of the components.). 
* It is finally time to mint our collection. Select the Mint message from the list of execute messages for the CW721 component. The required fields? for minting an NFT are the following: Minted Token ID, Token Owner Address, Token Name, Original Publisher, and Token Image.
* The optional fields provide extra information for the NFT.
* Once the fields are populated, proceed to publishing.
* If you want to mint more than 1, use the Batch Mint execute message. For each NFT you want to mint, select “Add Item”. Fill out the fields and publish to the chain.
* Congratulations! You have set up and minted an NFT collection.

## Guide 3: Creating Your First NFT Auction

**Setup**

* To begin, import your previous build from the Guide 2 “Building An App” into the web-app by selecting “Import Template” in the ADO builder.
* Rename the App and NFT collection to a more suitable name, and don't forget to update the minter address if you've switched to a different chain or wallet.
* Next, add an “Auction” component to the App and give it a suitable name. Then, you can publish the App to the chain and start setting up your auctions.
* First, mint some NFTs that you will be auctioning. In the assets page locate your new app and the CW721 component, select the Batch Mint execute to mint 3 (or however many tokens you’d like to mint) tokens. Once done, “publish” to the chain. 

**Auction/Sale**

* To start an auction for your NFTs, send the NFT to the auction and attach the appropriate message using the **SendNft** execute message for the CW721 component.
* Fill out the required field - Recipient Address.
* Then, provide the Token ID of the NFT you want to send.
* In addition, select the message to attach along with your NFT. Select “Auction” from the “Base ADO” options, then select “CW721 start auction”
* Finally, configure the auction options: Coin denomination, duration of the auction in milliseconds, specify the minimum bid allowed (floor price) and specify when the auction starts
* To set up as a private auction, you can provide a whitelist of addresses allowed to bid on the NFT.
* Once done configuring the fields, publish the message to the chain.
* To sell an NFT, select Transfer Agreement from the list of “execute”messages.
`You will need to specify the following fields: Amount, Denom, Purchaser, and Token ID. Once the fields are filled out, publish the message to the chain.`
* Congratulations, you just minted and sold an NFT using aOS.

## Guide 4: Utilizing Andromeda Modules to Further Extend your App

* In this example, you will extend the App one step further by utilizing the Andromeda Modules to add rates to the auctions.
* Before you start building, you will need to define your App. For this App, assume the following (stipulations written on the page)
* Next, let us briefly discuss the concept of modules. Modules are components that can be added as an extension to other ADOs. Our most popular modules are aRates Module and Address-List Module
* For this example, you will be adding the rates module to the auction component to add taxes on our auction sales.
* Open a new blank canvas and get started. Add a CW721 component and fill its panel. Then add an auction component.
* Then, select **Add Item** under the “Selected Modules” field in the auction component and fill in the following fields: Identifier, Module Type, Is Module Able to be Modified.
* Next add the rates component/module to your build. Note: there are two types of rates, Taxes or Royalties. A tax is a value added tax and a royalty is a reduction in what was paid in tokens.
* Then specify the recipients of this rate.
* Next, specify the recipients for the funds. To add a recipient, select "Add item" under the recipients section in the panel and set the percentage.
* Congratulations! All the components are set up, you can now publish the App to the chain and view it in your assets page.
